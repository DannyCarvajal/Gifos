# GIFOS PROJECT 

A platform created to explore your preferred Gifs and download them, and to visualize trending topics and Gifs, you can select your favorite Gifs and even create your own Gifs. 

It was created with html & css, sass as preprocessor; and mostly vanilla javascript with the RTC library to record your gifs
